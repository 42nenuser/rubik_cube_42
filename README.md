# Rubik's Cube Visualizer + algo

## Overview
This project is a **Rubik's Cube visualizer** built using **Three.js**. It currently renders a simple **2x2 Rubik's Cube**, and the next step is to develop an algorithm to solve a **3x3 Rubik's Cube** in either **Python** or **C++** and parse the output to Three.js for visualization.

## Features
- **3D Rendering** of a 2x2 Rubik's Cube using Three.js.
- **Camera/keyboard Controls** to navigate around the cube + moving the cubelets with the keyboard 
- **Scene Management** for organizing rendering logic.
- **Modular Design** with separate files for different functionalities.

## 🚀 Next Steps

### 🎯 Objective
- 🧩 **Write a program** that finds the **shortest solution** to a **3x3 Rubik’s Cube** given a sequence of moves.
- ⏳ **Solve the cube** in an average of **50 moves or fewer** within **3 seconds**.
- 🔄 Uses **Half-Turn Metric (HTM)** for move counting.

### ⚙️ Technical Requirements
- ✅ The program must **accept a scramble sequence** as input.
- 📜 Output the solution in **standard Rubik’s notation**:  
  `F, R, U, B, L, D`
- ❌ **Prohibited moves**:  
  - `M, E, S` (middle layer moves)  
  - `x, y, z` (cube rotations)
- 🖥️ Written in **any language**:  
  `C, C++, Python, Java, etc.`
- 🚫 **No external libraries** that solve the cube are allowed.


## Installation and Setup
To set up and run the project, follow these steps:

### 1. Clone the Repository
```sh
git clone <repository-url>
cd rubik_cube_42/src
```

### 2. Install Dependencies
```sh
npm install
```

### 3. Run the Development Server
This project uses **Vite** for local development. Start the server with:
```sh
npm run dev
```
The app will be available at **http://localhost:5173/**.

## Usage
- Open **http://localhost:5173/** in your browser.
- Interact with the 2x2 Rubik's Cube using the mouse and the keyboard 
- Modify `World/components/cube.js` to change cube behavior.
- Future updates will include a 3x3 solving algorithm integration.

## Dependencies
- **Three.js** (for 3D rendering)
- **Vite** (for fast development)
